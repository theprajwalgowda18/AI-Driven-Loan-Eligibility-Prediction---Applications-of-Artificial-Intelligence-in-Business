Project Description

This project leverages machine learning to automate and enhance loan approval predictions, enabling financial institutions to streamline decision-making processes. Using historical customer data, the project identifies key factors influencing loan approvals and optimizes predictive models to ensure accuracy, aligning with real-world banking applications.

Key Highlights

Objective
	•	Automate loan eligibility predictions to save time and reduce subjectivity.
	•	Analyze historical data to uncover factors affecting loan approvals.

Data Analysis
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Applicants with good credit history achieved >80% approval rates.
	•	Semi-urban properties and applicant income emerged as significant predictors.
	•	Engineered features and handled missing data using statistical imputation for robust model training.

Model Development
	•	Developed and compared three machine learning models:
	•	Logistic Regression:
	•	Accuracy: 86%, Precision: 84%, Recall: 98% (after tuning).
	•	Decision Tree:
	•	Accuracy: 79%, avoided overfitting through hyperparameter tuning.
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
	•	Accuracy: 81% (untuned), but tuning degraded performance.
	•	Used grid search for hyperparameter tuning to maximize model performance.

Business Impact
	•	Faster and More Reliable Decisions: Reduced manual loan assessments.
	•	Risk Mitigation: Improved borrower evaluation to minimize defaults.

Recommendations
	•	Focus on applicants with strong credit history and semi-urban property loans.
	•	Consider co-applicant income for joint applications.

Ethical AI Integration
	•	Addressed biases in the dataset to ensure fairness and transparency.
	•	Prioritized data privacy and accountability for AI-driven predictions.
