Description:
This project aimed to automate and enhance loan approval predictions using machine learning, enabling financial institutions to streamline decision-making. Leveraging historical customer data, the project identified key factors influencing approvals and optimized models for accuracy, ensuring practical application in banking operations.

Key Highlights

Objective
 • Automate loan eligibility predictions to save time and reduce subjectivity.
 • Analyze historical data to uncover factors affecting loan approvals.

Data Analysis
 •  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 •  Applicants with good credit history achieved >80% approval rates.
 •  Semi-urban properties and applicant income emerged as significant predictors.
 •  Features were engineered, and missing data was imputed statistically for robust model training.

Model Development
 • Developed and compared three machine learning models:
 Logistic Regression:
 • Accuracy: 86%, Precision: 84%, Recall: 98% (after tuning).
 Decision Tree:
 • Accuracy: 79%, avoided overfitting through hyperparameter tuning.
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
 • Accuracy: 81% (untuned), but tuning degraded performance.

 • Used grid search for hyperparameter tuning to maximize model performance.

Business Impact
 • Faster and More Reliable Decisions: Reduced manual loan assessments.
 • Risk Mitigation: Improved borrower evaluation to minimize defaults.
 
Recommendations:
 • Emphasize credit history and semi-urban property loans.
 • Consider co-applicant income in joint loans.

Ethical AI Integration
 • Addressed biases in the dataset to ensure fairness and transparency.
 • Prioritized data privacy and accountability for AI-driven predictions.

Impact:
This project highlights the potential of machine learning in transforming financial operations, showcasing actionable insights for financial institutions to improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.
